# RMA Inspection Guidelines

## Inspection Process

1. **Visual Inspection**
   - Check for physical damage
   - Verify all components present
   - Document condition with photos

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Power on test for electronics
   - Basic operation verification
   - Feature testing based on category

3. **Condition Grading**
   - **NEW**: Unopened, original packaging
   - **LIKE_NEW**: Opened but unused, all packaging
   - **GOOD**: Light use, minimal wear
   - **FAIR**: Moderate use, visible wear
   - **POOR**: Heavy use, significant wear
   - **DAMAGED**: Non-functional or broken

## Recommendation Matrix

| Condition | Functionality | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| NEW/LIKE_NEW | WORKING | FULL_REFUND |
| GOOD | WORKING | FULL_REFUND or PARTIAL_REFUND |
| FAIR | WORKING | PARTIAL_REFUND |
| POOR | WORKING | EXCHANGE or REJECT |
| ANY | NOT_WORKING | FULL_REFUND or REPAIR |
| DAMAGED | ANY | REJECT |

## Special Considerations

- Warranty returns always qualify for FULL_REFUND if defective
- Wrong items shipped get FULL_REFUND regardless of condition
- Customer loyalty tier affects benefit of doubt in borderline cases
