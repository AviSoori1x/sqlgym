# Corporate Liquidity Management Guidelines

## Cash Pooling Structures

### Zero Balance Pools
- **Purpose**: Maximize interest earnings by concentrating cash
- **Mechanism**: Sweep all excess funds to master account at end of day
- **Best For**: Companies with predictable cash flows
- **Minimum Participation**: 3 accounts, $5M aggregate balance
- **Fees**: $500/month per pool + $100/month per participant

### Target Balance Pools  
- **Purpose**: Maintain optimal operating balances while earning on excess
- **Mechanism**: Maintain target balance, sweep excess above threshold
- **Best For**: Companies needing specific working capital levels
- **Target Setting**: Based on 30-day average outflows + 20% buffer
- **Rebalancing**: Daily at 3:00 PM EST

### Threshold Sweep Pools
- **Purpose**: Opportunistic cash optimization with minimal disruption
- **Mechanism**: Sweep only when balance exceeds predetermined threshold
- **Best For**: Companies with volatile cash flows
- **Threshold Setting**: Typically 2-5x average daily balance
- **Monitoring**: Real-time with intraday sweeps available

## Liquidity Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Framework
1. **Daily Cash Flow Volatility**: Standard deviation of 30-day flows
2. **Account Concentration**: Percentage of total balances in single account
3. **Industry Risk Factors**: Sector-specific liquidity considerations
4. **Seasonal Patterns**: Historical cash flow seasonality analysis

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **Low Risk**: Volatility < 10% of average balance
- **Medium Risk**: Volatility 10-25% of average balance  
- **High Risk**: Volatility > 25% of average balance
- **Critical**: Negative available balance or overdraft utilization

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Automated Alerts**: Balance below minimum thresholds
2. **Relationship Manager Notification**: Unusual transaction patterns
3. **Credit Committee Review**: Exposure exceeding client limits
4. **Regulatory Reporting**: Large cash transaction reporting (>$10M)

## Operational Guidelines
