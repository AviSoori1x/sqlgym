## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

### **Domain Selection Rationale**
Five domains were chosen to represent the complete business ecosystem:

1. **Customer Service** - Universal business function, workflow-heavy
2. **Finance** - Complex regulations, risk management, numerical precision
3. **Retail CPG** - Customer analytics, marketing attribution, supply chain
4. **Healthcare** - Clinical workflows, regulatory compliance, safety-critical
5. **Energy Manufacturing** - Industrial operations, environmental compliance, safety management

### **Subdomain Selection Process**
Within each domain, 8-10 subdomains were selected based on:
- **Business Criticality**: Core operational workflows
- **Data Complexity**: Rich entity relationships and business logic
- **Query Diversity**: Different analytical patterns and SQL constructs
- **Industry Relevance**: Real-world business scenarios
- **Educational Value**: Progressive complexity for learning

### **Business System Naming Strategy**
Each subdomain was mapped to actual enterprise systems:
- **Authenticity**: Real company names users recognize
- **Context**: Immediate understanding of business domain
- **Engagement**: More interesting than generic names
- **Realism**: Matches actual enterprise environments

Examples:
- `claims_processing` ‚Üí **Anthem Claims System**
- `chatbot_deflection` ‚Üí **ZenDesk AI Support**
- `consumer_lending_loans_cards` ‚Üí **Chase Consumer Banking**

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **Schema Design Process**
```sql
-- 1. Start with core business entities
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,  -- Business identifier
    -- Rich demographics and business context
);

-- 2. Add domain-specific workflow entities
CREATE TABLE service_requests (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES customers(id),
    -- Complex workflow with business enums
    request_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(request_type IN ('INSTALL', 'REPAIR', 'MAINTENANCE')),
    -- JSON for flexible data
    skills_required TEXT NOT NULL, -- JSON array
);

-- 3. Implement strategic indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_service_requests_status ON service_requests(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_requests_date ON service_requests(requested_date);
```

### **Data Population Strategy**
```python
# Deterministic generation for reproducibility
rng = get_rng(args.seed)  # SEED=42 throughout

# Realistic business distributions
status = rng.choices(['ACTIVE', 'INACTIVE'], weights=[0.85, 0.15])

# Enterprise scale targeting
CUSTOMERS = 5000          # Primary entities: 3k-15k
CLAIMS = 25000           # Secondary entities: 5k-30k  
CLAIM_LINES = 50000      # Facts: 150k-800k

# Proper relationship modeling
for customer in customers:
    num_claims = rng.randint(2, 8)  # Realistic distribution
    for claim in claims:
        # Rich business logic in data generation
```

### **Quality Assurance Framework**
```sql
-- Comprehensive validation patterns
-- 1. Referential integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM child_table c 
LEFT JOIN parent_table p ON c.parent_id = p.id 
WHERE p.id IS NULL;

-- 2. Business logic validation
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM loans 
WHERE maturity_date <= origination_date;

-- 3. Performance verification
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 'CUST123';
```

## üé™ Innovation Highlights

### **Multi-Turn Conversation Framework**
```markdown
## Task 1: Business Analysis
**User**: What's our claims approval rate?
**Assistant**: I'll analyze claims processing performance.
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM medical_claims GROUP BY status;
```

**User**: How does this vary by provider specialty?
**Assistant**: Breaking down by specialty:
```sql
SELECT p.specialty, 
       COUNT(*) as total_claims,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN mc.status = 'APPROVED' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as approval_rate
FROM medical_claims mc
JOIN providers p ON mc.provider_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.specialty;
```
```

### **Evidence-Based Query Innovation**
```sql
-- Business policies accessible via SQL
SELECT json_extract(value, '$.approval_criteria') as criteria
FROM evidence_kv 
WHERE key = 'underwriting_policy';
```

### **Performance Demonstration Framework**
```sql
-- Fast: Uses unique constraint index
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 'CUST123';

-- Slow: Forces table scan
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id LIKE '%123%';
```

for i in range(1, CUSTOMERS + 1):
    credit_score = rng.randint(450, 850)
    # Income correlates with credit score
    income_ranges = {(450, 580): (20000, 40000), (580, 670): (35000, 75000)}
    income = rng.uniform(*income_ranges[credit_tier])
    # Rich business context in every field
```

### **Task Pattern Development**
**Initial Tasks (Basic)**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = 1;
```

**Evolved Tasks (Multi-Turn Business Conversations)**:
```markdown
**User**: What's our claims approval rate?
**Assistant**: I'll analyze claims processing performance.
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM medical_claims GROUP BY status;
```

**User**: How does this vary by provider specialty?
**Assistant**: Breaking down by specialty:
```sql
SELECT p.specialty, COUNT(*) as claims, 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN mc.status = 'APPROVED' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as approval_rate
FROM medical_claims mc JOIN providers p ON mc.provider_id = p.id GROUP BY p.specialty;
