## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **1. Choose Your Domain**
```bash
# Customer Service
cd customer_service/chatbot_deflection
sqlite3 zendesk_ai_support_normalized.db

# Healthcare  
cd healthcare/claims_processing
sqlite3 anthem_claims_system_normalized.db

# Finance
cd finance/consumer_lending_loans_cards  
sqlite3 chase_consumer_banking_normalized.db
```

### **2. Explore the Data**
```sql
-- See all tables
.tables

-- Check data volume
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM main_entity_table;

-- Run sample business query
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM business_workflow_table GROUP BY status;
```

### **3. Try Sample Tasks**
Each subdomain includes 15+ multi-turn sample tasks in `sample_text_to_sql_tasks.md`

### **4. Use Evidence-Based Queries**
```sql
-- Access business policies and rules
SELECT json_extract(value, '$.business_rules') 
FROM evidence_kv 
WHERE key = 'domain_policy';
```
